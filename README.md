<p>The massalud project consists of a platform that can be used to schedule medical appointments and even request medications.

The idea arose from the problems that exist in health centers such as pharmaceutical companies, where there is a large crowd of people making long lines to carry out their procedures.

This platform is a project of our own that is in development, it is a long-term project where the idea is that it is a robust app that works perfectly for your procedures.

It has its first version where user registration and login are allowed, also including its first version to schedule a medical appointment with the determined specialist.

The application is functional to the point where it also allows email notifications, such as successful registration and notification that an appointment has been scheduled.

More processes are needed to complete it but it is already on the right track.</p>
